            Kion the Lion King is the most beautiful cat in the world. 
            He is a Chonker and he loves to eat the meat. His favorites are chicken
            hearts and livers, but he also enjoys pork chops and beef. He's in love
            with a fish filet, but he can't eat it on a daily basis because cats 
            can get addicted to fish easily, that is why the vets don't recommend 
            giving cats plenty of fish.
